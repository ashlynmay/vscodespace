Ten HTML tags I used:
<p></p>
<meta>
<script></script>
<link>
<img>
<button></button>
<ul></ul>
<li></li>
<span>
<form></form>

Five CSS properties I used:
border-radius
background-color
padding-left
margin-right
text-align

I chose to use JavaScript to warn the user when they click to see my very unimpressive resume, as it is very unimpressive, 
and I used Bootstrap mainly for the included styling and html for cards and the navigation bar.
